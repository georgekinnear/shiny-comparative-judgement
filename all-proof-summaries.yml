    \(\left\{ \dfrac{1}{2^k}: k \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\) has an infinite number of terms in the interval (0,1) . If (0,1) is denumerable, there is a function that can map a number, \(n\), onto all elements of (0,1). We use only one of the two decimal representations for simplicity as the answer is still the same, choosing decimals that end in 0s rather than 9s to infinity. For ever unique decimal, (\a\), there is a decimal in which 5s are replaced by 3s and all other numbers replaced by 5. \(b\) is 0 so \(b \in (0,1)\). \(b \neq f(n)\) due to the change in digits so does not map to every element in (0,1).

Those expansions with recurring 9s are also discounted as there are 2 representations of those numbers. Then a number (\(b\)) is constructed that is in the form \(0.555 \dots\) unless at the \(n^{th}\) point after the decimal point in \(a\), there is a 5.

We know that \(b \neq a\) for any \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) so \(f(n)\) doesn't map any \(n\) to \(b\), which contradicts the assumption.
    There is a function (\(\sim\)) which maps \(n\) to (0,1) for \(a = 0.a_1a_2a_3 \dots\) any \(a\) with recurring 9s are discounted.

Then they assign part of the interval to each natural numbers from the function as is required by the assumption using variables. Then they clear up any confusion with an infinite string of 9s and zero's by saying they won't use numbers that at some point start repeating 9 forever.

    The proof states that because there's a subset in the interval that's infinite, the interval must be infinite. It then states the numbers in decimal form 0 to 1. Some numbers contain an infinite set of 9's but these are not included in the proof. It then gives a number '\)b\)' and tries to find \(b\)'s value within the range 0 and 1 but it cannot be done, therefore proving the theorem.

    The interval (0,1) is uncountable as includes subset \(\left\{\dfrac{1}{2^k}: k \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\) which is finite, therefore (0,1) is finite. The function \(f: N \rightarrow\) (0,1) is a bijection. So we write images of \(f\), n \(\in \mathbb{N}\). Some elements have different strings, e.g. end in 9's or 0's. \(b = 0.b_1b_2b_3b_4\) where \(b_i =\) 5 if \(a_{ii} \neq\) 5 and \(b_i =\) 3 if \(a_{ii} =\) 5.
