    The interval (0,1) contains \(\left\{ \dfrac{1}{2^k}: k \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \Rightarrow f(n) = 0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}\dots
    0.a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}\dots
    \vdots\)
    If we have \(b = 0.b_1b_2B_3\dots\) and every time \(a_{ii} = 5\) make \(b_i = 3\) and \(a_{ii} \neq 5\) make \(b_i = 5, b\) will always be different to \(f(n)\), 
    \(0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13} \neq 0.b_1b_2B_3\dots \therefore\) no matter what number \(f(n)\) is there will always be \(b \neq f(n) \in (0,1)\) so (0,1) is uncountable.

    (0,1) is infinite. Suppose (0,1) is denumerable, there is a function \(f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow (0,1): f(n) = 0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}a_{n4}a_{n5}\). We don't use decimals with an infinite string of 9's i.e. \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, f(n) =  0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}a_{n4}a_{n5}\). Let \(b =  0.b_1b_2b_3b_4b_5\). If \(b\) differs from \(f(n)\) in the \(n^{th}\) decimal place then (0,1) is not denumerable.

    \((0,1) \subseteq \left\{\dfrac{1}{2^k}:k \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\); both are infinite. Suppose (0,1) is denumerable. \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow (0,1)\) that is one-to-one and onto (0,1). \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}\), \(f(n) = 0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3} \dots\) where there is no \(k\) s.t. \(\forall i > k\), \(a_{ni} = 9\). Now \(b = 0.b_1b_2b_3b_4 \dots\) where \(b_i = 5\) if \(a_{ii} \neq 5\). \(b_i = 3\) if \(a_{ii} = 5\). We know that \(b \in (0,1)\) however \(b\) differs from \(f(n)\) in the \(n^{th}\) decimal place. So \(b \neq f(n)\) for \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). And \(b\) does not belong in the range \(f\), \(f\) is not onto \((0,1) \textit{\#}\)

    The numbers between \(0, 1\) is infinite. The function \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow (0,1)\) takes all natural numbers into the interval (0,1). Examples \(f(1) = 0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}a_{14}\). \(f(2) = 0.a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}a_{24}\) etc. The decimal representation of infinite 0's and infinite 9's are the same as \(0.9\dot{9} = 0.1\dot{0}\). Our statement is the interval (0,1) is denumerable. \(\left\{ \dfrac{1}{2^k}: k \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\) is a subset of the intervals of (0,1). We are saying there isn't a value \(> k\). For \(a_n\) that value \(= 9\). Now we introduce \(b\) so that the decimal place value will be as if the corresponding \(a\) value is not 5 and 3 if \(a\) = 5, \(b\) differs from \(f(n)\). So not in range therefore \(f\) not in (0,1) which contradicts.

    Show infinite subset in interval. Assume denumerable. Then function 1 to 1 onto (0,1). \(f(n) = 0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}a_{n4} \dots\) represent so no \(k\) s.t. \(i > k a_{ni} = 9\). Define \(b = 0.b_1b_2b_3b_4 \dots\) where \(b_i = 5\) if \(a_{ii} \neq 5 b_i = 3\) if \(a_{ii} = 5\). Deduce \(b \neq f(n)\) for any \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) which means \(b\) doesn't belong to \(f\). \(\therefore f\) not onto \((0,1) \Rightarrow (0,1)\) isn't denumerable by contradiction.

    To prove (0,1) is uncountable, first suppose (0,1) \underline{is} denumerable. Then we can form a function \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow (0,1)\) which is one-to-one and onto (0,1) and show that there are decimals that differ in the \(n\)th decimal place, so (0,1) is uncountable.

    We assume the interval is countable an that we would therefore have a bijection \(f\) onto the interval. Some elements would have 2 decimal expansions so we removes those with infinite 9's to make each element unique. Turn every expansion into a combination of 3's and 5's and prove this isn't in \(f\), but is in the interval. Therefore no \(f\), so interval uncountable.

    (0,1) is infinite, prove by infinite subsets. Using contradiction, we can show (0,1) is not denumerable because one number always has a different n\)^{th}\) decimal place to that of the functions.

    \(f(n)\) is an decimal in the set (0,1), which is not infinite despite confusing an infinite subset. By swapping 5's and 3's in \(a_{ni}\), you produce a number \(b_{ni}\) which is not in the range of \(f\).

    It is a proof by contradiction with \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow\) (0,1) which is one-to-one on (0,1). The decimal expansions have infinite strings of numbers. \(b\) differs from \(f(n)\) at some points. \(b\) doesn't belong to range \(f\).

    \(\dfrac{1}{2^k}\) is a subset of (0,1) (where \(k \in \mathbb{N}\)). It is infinite as \(\dfrac{1}{2^k}\) remains within (0,1) as \(k \rightarrow \infty\) and so (0,1) is infinite. There is a bijection \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow\) (0,1). 
    Proof by contradiction. Shows (0,1) is not denumerable \(b\) does not satisfy the bijection for all n \(\in \mathbb{N} \Rightarrow\) is uncountable.

    The interval (0,1) includes an infinite subset \(\left\{\dfrac{1}{2^k}: k \in N \right\}\) . However because there can be no one to one map from \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow\) (0,1) due to unique decimals strings for each \(f(n)\) then the open interval is uncountable.

    The proof aims to to prove that (0,1) is uncountable. It achieves this by assuming that it isn't, then finding an example which is contradicting, hence proving uncountability by contradiction.

    This proof represents al countable numbers in the subset and uses these numbers which map 'one to many' for \(k\), which have infinite decimal places in the subset by connecting it one to one. \(a_i\) has a set value for \(b_i\) = 3 but when \(b_i\) = 5 \(a_i \neq\) 5 so \(a_i\) can take any other value meaning the solution is only unique for \(b_i\) = 3 not when \(a_i \neq\) 5.
