We are a group of year 4 mathematics students and part of our final year project involves looking at what methods of comparing students’ proof summaries (e.g. ranking items, or comparing two items at once) is most effective at creating a score for each summary. We would hope that this project would help educators with effectively marking proofs and more open-ended maths questions, add to the existing research of this topic in Maths Education, and benefit the mathematics community as a whole. The questions in this survey are going to be used to gather data for our project topic, and we’d really appreciate your help with it.
 

The judging session should take about 15-20 minutes online. To participate, please read the participation sheet select ‘I consent’.

 

Thank you in advance,

Jack, Alannah, Rachel, Anna and Shidi,

 

(4th Year Maths Students)
