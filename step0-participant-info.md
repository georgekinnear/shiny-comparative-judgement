## Comparing students' summaries of proofs

We are a group of year 4 mathematics students and part of our final year project involves research into methods for effectively marking proofs and more open-ended maths questions.

The questions in this survey are going to be used to gather data for our project topic, and we’d really appreciate your help with it.
The survey involves comparing several students’ summaries of a proof using different methods (e.g. ranking items, or comparing two items at once), so we can investigate which methods are most effective at creating a score for each summary.

The judging session should take about 15-20 minutes online.

Thank you in advance,

Jack, Alannah, Rachel, Anna and Shidi,

(4th Year Maths Students)
